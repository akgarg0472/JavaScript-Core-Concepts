/*
    â†’ OOPS is a paradigm(pattern) in programming that focuses on objects rather than functions.
    â†’ OOPS is not a programming language, it is a style/pattern of programming.
    
    â†’ OOPs consists of four concepts:
        - Encapsulation
        - Abstraction
        - Inheritance
        - Polymorphism

    â†’ In object-orinted programming, we group functions and variables which are related to each other into a single unit called object which is the core pillar of object-oriented programming. Variables are also known as properties and functions are also known as methods. (Sounds cool!! ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰)

    â†’ Encapsulation is defined as the grouping of methods (functions) and properties (variables) involved in the execution of related task.
    Example: Medical capsule contains chemicals and medicines which are doing some related stuff (let's assume pain killer), so instead of giving multiple medicines to cure the same disease, a single capsule (containing all those medicines) is given. Encapsulation in OOPS is same as this capsule. We are combining multiple variables and methods doing the related task in a single bundle/group and this phenomena is known as Encapsulation.
    Programming example: CLASS
    Advantages: Reusability, reduced complexity

    â†’ Abstraction is defined as the concept of hiding the actual internal implementations from the code sitting outside the object and only exposing the necessary information about the object. 
    Example: Common person is not aware of how computer is working behind the scenes, he/she only needs to know how computer works like switching on the CPU, using I/O devices to get the job done. Knowing how computer is capturing the signals from these devices is not of their job.

    â†’ Inheritance is actually reusing the code. Inheritance is defined as the inheriting (getting) properties(variables) & behaviour(methods) from their parent to remove redundancy. 
    Example: Children inherit properties from parents (like eyes color, skin color) and other behaviors. In programming world, if we have something already created and we want to reuse that code then we can inherit our object code from existing code which gives us access to the properties and methods of the code from wnich our object code is inherited.
    Advantages: Code Reusability, Reduces redundancy

    â†’ Polymorphism means "many forms" or "multiple forms". It is technique to perform a task in different ways according to the needs.
    Example: Handling customers at a shop. Every customer needs to be handled in different way.
